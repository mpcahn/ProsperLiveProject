# ProsperLiveProject
This repo contains the relevent project files that I worked on with Prosper IT Consulting posted with their permission to showcase my ability to work on a team on a functioning web project.

## Edit History
### ProsperBulletin

Make sure the delete icon on the Index page of the Bulletins will delete the record without having to reload the page, also add animation.

Modify the logic in the Bulletins controller that has to do with the events pulled from Meetups API to filter the meetups that are shown to a user 
depending on whether they are Seattle(local or remote) vs Portland(local or remote)

### Notifications

On the Update view of the Notifications controller remove the "Create New" link from the view.

Create an email export button on the Update view of the Notifications controller styled like the email export button the Index page of the JPStudentRundown.

Change the search field in the Update view of the JPNotifications controller to a dropdown that just filters for Hires and Graduates.

Update the date in the JPLatestContact table for a specific user when the email icon is clicked in the table on the Update view of the JPNoticiations controller.

### StudentRundown

In the StudentRundown index view, move the group of buttons to be to the right edge of the container.

For the dropdowns in the "checklist completion" column on the JPStudentRundown index view, change the text to be lowercase.	

### Hires

Style the Details view of the JPHires contoller to have a banner at the top and display the congratulatory header on top of that (similar to what is 
being done on the Analytics view of the Analytics controller). Your choice on the banner image/styling	

### StudentIndex

In the StudentIndex view of the JPApplications controller, move the search bar to be left of the container and change the current one the style 
of the one found in the JPNotifications update view.

### General

Increase the size of the pencil, trashcan, envelope, and grad cap icons throughout the site so it is easier to distinguish what the icons are.
